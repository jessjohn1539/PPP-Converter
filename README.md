# Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Salary Converter üí∏

A simple, yet powerful web-based tool that allows users to convert their salary from one country‚Äôs currency to another using Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). The converter helps users understand how much salary is needed in a foreign country to maintain a similar quality of life.

## üìå Problem Statement

In today‚Äôs globalized world, more and more people are moving abroad for work, seeking higher salaries or better living conditions. However, many are unaware that a higher salary in another country doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a higher standard of living. This is because foreign exchange rates don‚Äôt reflect the differences in the cost of living between countries.

For example, earning 100,000 USD in the United States may not provide the same lifestyle as earning 80,000 Euros in France. This is where Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) comes in, offering a more realistic salary comparison by adjusting for differences in the cost of goods and services between countries.

The PPP Salary Converter addresses this gap by helping users calculate how much salary they would need in a target country to match their current standard of living based on PPP factors, thus giving them a more informed idea of what salary to aim for when moving abroad.

## ‚ÄºÔ∏èWhy This Matters 

Many individuals moving abroad are not fully aware of how their salary would translate to the actual purchasing power in their new country. Often, people assume that earning a higher number in a foreign currency equates to better financial standing, without realizing the drastic differences in the cost of living.

For instance, earning 50,000 INR in India is not the same as earning 50,000 USD in the US in terms of purchasing power. This tool helps people gain a more accurate understanding of what salary they should aim for abroad to maintain or improve their quality of life.
